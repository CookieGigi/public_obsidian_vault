Software engineer with 4 years of experience designing, implementing and managing web applications projects. My last job principally involved technologies like ASP.Net, Microsoft SQL Server, JS/JQuery and HTML/CSS, but outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic learner who likes to explore other languages such as Python and Rust or other domains like self-hosting or Linux.

I’m traveler who after traveling 9 months, search for a stable job in Malaysia.
